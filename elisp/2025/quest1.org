* Part I
There's something remarkable about the eggshell you hatched from. Faintly glowing dots and lines cover its entire surface. Even stranger is the fact that you understand what they mean! Is it a unique language that all members of your species are born knowing?
After taking a closer look, it turns out that the eggshell has three separate sections. Each section contains a list of names and a list of instructions specifying how to navigate through the list of names. Before executing the first instruction, you are at the first name of the list. Each instruction begins with the letter

 R 

or

 L 

, followed by a certain number, which simply indicates how many positions to move to the (R)ight or to the (L)eft from your current position.
You're taking a closer look at the first section ( your notes ). The description says that if you can't follow the full instruction without going off the list, you do as many moves as you can to stay on it. For example, if the next instruction is

 L3 

and you are at the second name of the list, you move only one position to the left. The description additionally states that the name you land on at the end of the entire process represents the name of the dragonduck inside the egg! So, you're a dragonduck, and you'll find out your name soon!
Example based on the following notes:

Vyrdax,Drakzyph,Fyrryn,Elarzris

R3,L2,R3,L1

Start at the first name on the list: Vyrdax:

  ↓
Vyrdax  Drakzyph  Fyrryn  Elarzris

The first instruction is

 R3 

, so you move three positions to the right, landing on Elarzris:

                             ↓
Vyrdax  Drakzyph  Fyrryn  Elarzris

The next instruction is

 L2 

, so you move two positions to the left, landing on Drakzyph:

           ↓
Vyrdax  Drakzyph  Fyrryn  Elarzris

The next instruction is

 R3 

, but the list is too short for that move. Instead, you move as far as possible - to Elarzris:

                             ↓
Vyrdax  Drakzyph  Fyrryn  Elarzris

The final instruction is

 L1 

, moving one position left to

 Fyrryn 

. This is where the process ends:

                    ↓
Vyrdax  Drakzyph  Fyrryn  Elarzris


> how to read content from file and split by newline in emacs

⏺ Here are the common ways to read a file and split by newlines in Emacs Lisp:

  Simple: Read entire file and split

  ;; Read file into a list of lines
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents "path/to/file.txt")
    (split-string (buffer-string) "\n" t))

  The third argument t to split-string omits empty strings (trailing newlines).

  Alternative: Using f.el library (if available)

  ;; Requires f.el library
  (f-read-lines "path/to/file.txt")

  Manual line-by-line reading

  ;; Read lines into a list manually
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents "path/to/file.txt")
    (let ((lines '()))
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (not (eobp))
        (push (buffer-substring-no-properties
               (line-beginning-position)
               (line-end-position))
              lines)
        (forward-line 1))
      (nreverse lines)))

  Read entire file as string (no splitting)

  ;; Just get the file contents as a string
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents "path/to/file.txt")
    (buffer-string))

  Common pattern for Advent of Code style problems

  (defun read-input (filename)
    "Read FILENAME and return list of lines."
    (with-temp-buffer
      (insert-file-contents filename)
      (split-string (buffer-string) "\n" t)))

  ;; Usage
  (let ((lines (read-input "data/2024/day1.txt")))
    (mapcar #'string-to-number lines))

  The with-temp-buffer + insert-file-contents + split-string pattern is the most common and idiomatic approach in Emacs Lisp.

** COMMENT how to read file and split by line and assign first and second element to varaible in emacs lisp

⏺ Here are several ways to read a file, split by lines, and extract first/second elements in Emacs Lisp:

  Using let with car and cadr

  (let* ((lines (with-temp-buffer
                  (insert-file-contents "path/to/file.txt")
                  (split-string (buffer-string) "\n" t)))
         (first-line (car lines))
         (second-line (cadr lines)))
    ;; Use first-line and second-line here
    (message "First: %s, Second: %s" first-line second-line))

  Using nth

  (let* ((lines (with-temp-buffer
                  (insert-file-contents "path/to/file.txt")
                  (split-string (buffer-string) "\n" t)))
         (first-line (nth 0 lines))
         (second-line (nth 1 lines)))
    (message "First: %s, Second: %s" first-line second-line))

  Destructuring with pcase-let (modern Emacs)

  (pcase-let ((`(,first ,second . ,_rest)
               (with-temp-buffer
                 (insert-file-contents "path/to/file.txt")
                 (split-string (buffer-string) "\n" t))))
    (message "First: %s, Second: %s" first second))

  Using seq-let (Emacs 25+)

  (seq-let [first second]
      (with-temp-buffer
        (insert-file-contents "path/to/file.txt")
        (split-string (buffer-string) "\n" t))
    (message "First: %s, Second: %s" first second))

  Splitting each line into words

  If you want to split each line by spaces and get first/second words:

  (let* ((lines (with-temp-buffer
                  (insert-file-contents "path/to/file.txt")
                  (split-string (buffer-string) "\n" t)))
         (first-line (car lines))
         (words (split-string first-line))
         (first-word (car words))
         (second-word (cadr words)))
    (message "First word: %s, Second word: %s" first-word second-word))

  Processing all lines with first/second columns

  (defun process-file (filename)
    (let ((lines (with-temp-buffer
                   (insert-file-contents filename)
                   (split-string (buffer-string) "\n" t))))
      (dolist (line lines)
        (let* ((parts (split-string line))
               (first (car parts))
               (second (cadr parts)))
          (message "Line: %s | %s" first second)))))

  (process-file "data/2024/day1.txt")

  Complete Advent of Code example

  (defun solve-day1 (filename)
    (let* ((lines (with-temp-buffer
                    (insert-file-contents filename)
                    (split-string (buffer-string) "\n" t)))
           (first-line (car lines))
           (second-line (cadr lines)))
      ;; Process first and second lines
      (list first-line second-line)))

  (solve-day1 "data/2024/day1.txt")

  Key functions

  - car - first element (head)
  - cadr - second element (equivalent to (car (cdr list)))
  - caddr - third element
  - nth n list - nth element (0-indexed)
  - split-string - split string by delimiter

  The let* form is useful when later bindings depend on earlier ones.
